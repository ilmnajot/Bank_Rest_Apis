# Bank Cards Management System ðŸ’³

## Overview
This project is a **Bank Card Management System** built with Spring Boot.  
It provides functionality for **managing users, bank cards, and transactions**.  
The system implements **role-based access control (RBAC)** using Spring Security and JWT authentication.

---

## Features

### ðŸ”‘ Authentication & Authorization
- User registration and login
- Only admin registers the user and provides them with a password (`default role is `user``)
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (`ADMIN`, `USER`)
- Secure password hashing with BCrypt

### ðŸ‘¤ User Management
- Create and update employee accounts (admin)
- Change user credentials
- View user details
- User status management (`ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, etc.)

### ðŸ’³ Card Management
- Create new cards with encrypted card numbers
- Masked card number display
- View card details (with decrypted number)
- Update or delete cards (soft delete)
- Change card status (`ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `EXPIRED`)
- Automatic card expiration check (scheduled job)

### ðŸ’° Transactions
- Fill a card with balance (deposit)
- Transfer money between user cards
- Transaction history with type (`DEPOSIT`, `TRANSFER`)
- Balance checking

### ðŸ“Š Card Operations
- Retrieve all cards with filtering & pagination
- View only personal cards (authenticated user)
- Card validation (block/expire checks before transactions)

## API Endpoints (Examples)

### Authentication
- `POST /auths/login` â€“ Login with username & password
- `POST /auths/register-user` â€“ Register new user (admin only)
- `PUT /auths/change-password` â€“ Change password
- `PUT /autha/change-credentials/{id}` â€“ Change username/email
- `Put /auths/update-user-by-admin` - Change users' data by admin only
- `Get /get-user/{userId}` - getting a single user

### Card Management
- `POST /api/v1/cards/add-card` â€“ Create a new card
- `GET /api/v1/cards/get/{id}` â€“ Get card details
- `PUT /api/v1/cards/update-card/{cardId}` â€“ Update card
- `DELETE /api/v1/cards/delete-card/{cardId}` â€“ Delete card (soft delete)
- `GET /api/v1/cards/get-own-cards` â€“ Get userâ€™s own cards
- `PATCH /api/v1/cards/change-card-status/{cardId}` â€“ Change card status

## Database
- `users` â€“ stores user accounts (with roles & status)
- `cards` â€“ stores encrypted card numbers, balance, status
- `transactions` â€“ stores transaction history

---

## Security
- Password encryption with **BCrypt**
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based endpoint access
- Validation for card operations (blocked, expired)
